Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am a first-year Masters student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) pursuing an MS in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation. I am currently a Machine Learning intern in the Search Quality team at [Apple](https://machinelearning.apple.com/). 

In the summer of 2021, I graduated top of my class with a high first from [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) with a BSc (Hons) in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science. My [undergraduate honors thesis](https://project-archive.inf.ed.ac.uk/ug4/20212502/ug4_proj.pdf) on mitigating dataset bias in computer vision by artificially generating data from minority classes using GANs under the supervision of [Ajitha Rajan](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/arajan/) received an outstanding paper classification. I am interested in pursuing an academic career in machine learning and computational linguistics with a focus in robustness, ethics, and fairness.

In spring 2022, I conducted research under [Alan W. Black](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/) to develop tools and explore methodologies for generalizable text normalization for speech systems. Previously, I have worked as a spring or summer intern at Goldman Sachs, Google, YouTube, Amazon, and JP Morgan. Iâ€™ve also conducted research on computational social science and taught some machine learning classes in my undergraduate university.
